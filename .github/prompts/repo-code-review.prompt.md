You are a principal .NET architect and senior C# developer.

Review the currently uncommitted changes in this repository.

Review the codebase as if you are reviewing a pull request from another experienced developer.

Focus only on issues that would influence your decision to approve or reject the pull request.

Context:
- This project is being developed using Spec Kit.
- The current task list provides useful context for understanding the intent of the changes being reviewed.
- The solution is based on .NET 10, C# 14, ASP.NET Core, .NET Aspire and server-side Blazor using Fluent UI.

Focus on finding:

1. Bugs, defects or logic errors.
2. Security concerns.
3. Violations of .NET and C# best practices.
4. Architectural issues that will become expensive to fix later.
5. Code that is unnecessarily complex.
6. Areas where maintainability or testability will suffer.

Do NOT comment on:
- Formatting issues.
- Naming preferences unless they materially affect readability.
- Personal coding style preferences.
- Minor optimisations without measurable value.
- Features that have not yet been implemented
- Planned future work
- Stub implementations that are clearly placeholders
- Missing functionality unless the current code creates a defect

For each issue found:
- Provide severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- Explain why it matters.
- Suggest a concrete improvement.

At the end of the review provide:

Merge Recommendation:
- Approve
- Approve with minor concerns
- Request changes

Provide a brief explanation and only report issues you would expect a senior engineer to raise during a real pull request review. If no significant issues are found, explicitly say so.
